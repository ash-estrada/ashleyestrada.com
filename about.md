Hi! I'm Ash. I set this site up as a place to keep track of and share updates on projects and skills I'm working on.

I'm a student in Gainesville, Florida.

I received my associate's degree from Santa Fe College in May 2017. 

I'm continuing to study at Santa Fe College, working on transfer requirement courses (like Physics II 2/ Calc and College Chem I) for university engineering programs.

### More Information

I would like to develop or expand upon the following skills: CAD for 3D printing, 3D printing in general, soldering and practical electronics, basic robotics, amateur high powered rocketry, microcontrollers, youth education community outreach, programming, web development, and machine learning.

In addition to the above, my hobbies include playing the flute in the Santa Fe Wind Ensemble, going for lengthy rides on my road bike, 2D design, reading books, playing games on my 3DS, learning languages and coffee.
