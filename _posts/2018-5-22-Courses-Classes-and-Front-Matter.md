Online summer class at Santa Fe: 

- **COP2002** *"This course is intended to introduce students to the concepts of computer logic and programming. Problem solving skills using logical thinking are emphasized. Topics include but are not limited to: a brief history of computers and programming languages, data representation (binary and hexidecimal, integers, floating point numbers, and character strings), how to develop a program, including internal and external documentation, the three basic programming control structues (sequence, selection, and repetition), arrays, data files (time permitting), program modules, submodules and functions, and procedural vs object-oriented programming languages. The student is expected to use some math skills. There is a hands-on compnent which is designed to help students learn to use programming concepts. A free program called RAPTOR will be used for the hands-on component."*

I'm going to narrow the Udemy classes down to two. On top of that I'd like to get my Level 1 rocket launched and I want to start working on the flight computer project for the Level 2 rocket.
