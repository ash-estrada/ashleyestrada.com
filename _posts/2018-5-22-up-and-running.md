On using [this guide](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) by Barry Clark to throw this blog together.

I had the intention of the site things from the ground up, but at the same time I wanted a place to post updates on projects I'm working on and things I'm learning (which includes how to do things like build a website from the ground up and use Git and navigate GitHub). I think what I've done is an alright compromise.

## Using My Own Domain 

Rather than using ash-estrada.github.io, I opted to use my own domain, which I have through Google Domains. This just meant editing the CNAME file! 

## _config.yml

### Jekyll's Configuration File

Changed the title to my name and messed with the bio, filled a few other things out but pretty barebones atm. I'm planning on changing the icon sometime.

### Note to Self: 

> **Common problem #9:** Note that `_config.yml` changes are loaded at compile time, not runtime. This means that if you’re running `jekyll serve` locally and you edit `_config.yml`, then changes to it won’t be detected. You’ll need to kill and rerun `jekyll serve`.

## Content

> Use a third-party GitHub content editor, such as [Prose](prose.io) by Development Seed. It’s optimized for Jekyll, which makes it easy to edit Markdown, write drafts and upload images.

Writing this post with Prose currently and I'm enjoying the instant Markdown preview.
